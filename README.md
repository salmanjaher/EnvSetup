## What is this?

This tool was created to help you setup your environment for development. It will install the following languages:

- Python
- JavaScript (Node)
- Java
- C++

The following tools:

- Homebrew (Mac) / Chocolatey (Windows)
- Git
- VSCode

The Interactive mode will ask you which languages you want to install. It will also ask you if you want to install the tools. This is reccomended for beginners.

The Pro mode is for advanced users, who would like more freedom in what they want to install.

If you choose to develop in Python, this guide will also teach you how to setup a virtual environment to keep your projects separate from your system.
